# CourseTrackerBot
Reworking a discord bot for tracking UBC course seat availability and notify the user if there are seats remaining. 

**TODO list**:
- [X] Create a structural template for future functions
- [X] Track more than one course
- [X] Track for multiple users
- [X] Able to add tracking directly on discord

## Installation

```bash
npm i
```
## Usage
- create your own default.json inside config
```bash
npm start
```

Basic function is done. Will work on it again if needed. Moving on to a new project.
